* FIX BUG postfix: sasl_passwd contains multiple lines after consecutive runs => password should never change if one has already been created
* FIX BUG: "template missing" Warning: Variable access via 'pmtu' is deprecated. Use '@pmtu' instead. template[/root/supernodeFFFFM puppet/modules/fastd/templates/fastd.conf.erb]:27 (at /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/puppet/parser/templatewrapper.rb:76:in `method_missing')
* do not install radvd
* use proper template for /etc/rc.local, have it log stderr and stdout to /tmp/rc.local.log, do not exit on the first failed command
* remove pmtu from fastd-configuration
* enlarge size of multicast hash-table: echo 2048 > /sys/class/net/batbridge/bridge/hash_max
* make sure all changes from the working branch are merged to master
* remove fastd_web_service and fastd_web_service_auth
