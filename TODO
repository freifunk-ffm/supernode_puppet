* FIX BUG: do not overwrite openvpn config, just make sure that the values exist
* FIX BUG postfix: sasl_passwd contains multiple lines after consecutive runs => password should never change if one has already been created
* use proper template for /etc/rc.local, have it log stderr and stdout to /tmp/rc.local.log, do not exit on the first failed command
* fastd: allow null-cipher for mesh-vpn-1280 but do not allow it for mesh-vpn
* properly install ff-tools
* enlarge size of multicast hash-table: echo 2048 > /sys/class/net/batbridge/bridge/hash_max
